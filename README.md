# Yo ðŸ‘‹

I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for
ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have, are a very
particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills
that make me fully buzzword compliant; ideally suited for positions
involving web technology; leadership, google-fu, and communication skills to guide a
team or organization to success.

Nevertheless, I would fail to write bubble sort on a whiteboard. 
I look code up on the internet all the time. And I don't do riddles.

If you don't follow me now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you.
