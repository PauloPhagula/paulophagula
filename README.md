Hello

I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for
ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have, are a very
particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills
that make me fully buzzword compliant; ideally suited for positions
involving web technology; leadership and communication skills to guide a
team or organization to success.

If you don't follow me now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you.
